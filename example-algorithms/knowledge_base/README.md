# Knowledge Bases
Knowledge bases are structured collections of information that represent knowledge about a particular domain. It is essentially a large database that contains information about entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. The article provided a practical example of how to implement a knowledge base from texts. The basic steps involved:
1. Gathering and preprocessing the data
2. Extracting entities and relations
3. Organizing the extracted entities and relations into a knowledge graph
4. Visualizing the knowledge graph and exploring relationships between entities. [Read more about it here](https://medium.com/nlplanet/building-a-knowledge-base-from-texts-a-full-practical-example-8dbbffb912fa).
